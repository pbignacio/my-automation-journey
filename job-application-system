##Job Application System

## This system takes the data from a job applicant and adds it into a sheet for documentation and easy screening

##Step 1.
- Made a google form which serves as the starting point to collect data from the job applicant.
- I publish the form and it is currently active.

##Step 2.
- Make the first step of Zap and pick the "New Email" as the trigger. Configure and select value as "INBOX (ID:INBOX)".
- Continue and test the trigger to check the output of configuration. Once I confirmed, the first Zap is ready.

##Step 3.
- Created a google spreadsheet with the headers (row) of "Name", "Email", "Requested Position", "Job Experience"
- I have linked this worksheet into the Zap so that every new email that I receive will automatically collected and entered in the database.

Add the next steps.
