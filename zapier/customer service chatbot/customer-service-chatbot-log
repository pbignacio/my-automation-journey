## Customer Service Chatbot (Google Forms, Gmail, Chatgpt, Zapier)

Overview

This system collects job applicant data via a Google Form, stores it in a Google Spreadsheet, chatGPT then analyzes the message using conversation, then sends a reply back to the sender using Gmail.

Workflow Steps

## Step 1: Applicant Data Collection (Google Forms)

-- Created a Google Form to collect applicant details:

-- Customer Name, Email, Issue Description

-- Published the form and confirmed it is active and accepting responses.

## Step 2: Zapier Trigger – New Form Response

-- Created a new Zap.
-- Selected Google Forms → New Form Response as the trigger.
-- Connected the correct Google account.
-- Selected the correct form by file name.
-- Tested the trigger and confirmed the form data is captured correctly.

## Step 3: Store Applicant Data in Google Sheets

-- Created a Google Spreadsheet with the following headers:
-- Customer Name, Email, Issue Description
-- Added Google Sheets → Create Spreadsheet Row as the next Zap step.
-- Mapped each form field to the corresponding spreadsheet header.
-- Enabled header-based mapping.
-- Tested the action and confirmed all form submissions are correctly recorded in the spreadsheet.

## Step 4: Delay Response (Delay by Zapier)

--Added Delay by Zapier → Delay For.
--Configured a delay of 2 minutes for testing purposes.
--Planned production delay: 24 hours to simulate a natural, human response time and avoid instant automated replies.

## Step 5: Add ChatGPT to analyse body message

-- added chaptGPT and configured to conversation model
-- configured on how the chatbot should act or respond to the received message
-- tested the steps but was not aware that I had to generate an API key from OpenAI and that I have to add credit for ChatGPT to be usable for this step.
-- after generating an API key and adding credit, ChatGPT is now working as intended.
-- continued the steps, tested and now it is working.

## Step 5: Send Gmail reply

-- configured to send an email based on the reply or analysing of ChatGPT on the message.
-- send the email, tested to self first, was working fine.

## Step 6: Field Test

-- Sent the form to real users to fill up and see the final outcome.
-- worked perfectly, see attached screenshots for proof.
