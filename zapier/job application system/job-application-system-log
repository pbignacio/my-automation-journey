Job Application Automation System
📌 Project Overview

This system collects job application data from applicants and automatically stores it in a Google Sheet for documentation and easy screening. It also sends an automated acknowledgment email after a delay to simulate a more human response.

🛠 Tools Used

Google Forms

Zapier

Gmail

Google Sheets

🔄 System Workflow
Step 1: Google Form Setup

-- Created a Google Form to collect applicant information.

-- Published the form and confirmed it is active.

Step 2: Zapier Trigger (Corrected)

-- Initially configured the trigger incorrectly as Gmail: New Email.

-- Rectified the mistake by changing the trigger to Google Forms: New Form Response.

-- Selected the correct form file.

-- Tested the trigger using an actual form submission (not test data).

✅ Trigger confirmed working.

Step 3: Google Sheets Integration

-- Created a Google Sheet with the following headers:

-- Name | Email | Requested Position | Job Experience

-- Configured Zapier to map form responses to the correct spreadsheet headers.

-- Tested the action and verified data was logged correctly.

Step 4: Delay by Zapier

-- Added Delay by Zapier to simulate a natural response time.

Configured:

-- Delay For: 1 hour (testing)

-- Recommended Production Delay: 24 hours

Step 5: Automated Email Response

-- Configured Zapier to send an automated acknowledgment email after the delay.

-- Initial error encountered:

-- Email address variable was invalid due to using test data.

Resolution:

-- Submitted an actual form response and remapped variables correctly.

-- Retested successfully.
