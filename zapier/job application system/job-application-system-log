##Job Application System

## This system collects the data from a job applicant and adds it into a sheet for documentation and easy screening

## Step 1.
- Made a google form which serves as the starting point to collect data from the job applicant.
- I publish the form and it is currently active.

## Step 2.
- Make the first step of Zap and pick the "New Email" as the trigger. Configure and select value as "INBOX (ID:INBOX)".
- Continue and test the trigger to check the output of configuration. Once I confirmed, the first Zap is ready.

## Step 3.
- Created a google spreadsheet with the headers (row) of "Name", "Email", "Requested Position", "Job Experience"
- I have linked this worksheet into the Zap so that every new email that I receive will automatically collected and entered in the database.

Add the next steps.

-- Ok, I have made a mistake initially, instead of keeping the first step as a form, I have kept it as Gmail receving new email, this has been rectified.
-- after rectifying the mistake, I have set the trigger as "new form response" and configured according to the file name of the form. Tested the form and it came out ok.

## Step 3 again.
-- Configured so that all data filled according to the forms will reflect on the spreadsheet - It will read the header on the spreadsheet. I have selected according to the correct variable.
-- Tested the output so everything is ok according to the test.

## Step 4 - Add Delay by Zapier
-- This step includes adding the Delay by Zapier to make the reply feel like a real person and more personalized.
-- I’ve set the Delay For to 1 hour for testing purposes only. For actual use, it would be better to set this to 24 hours so the message feels more natural and human-like.

## Step 5 - Automatically send an email response after delay
-- I have setup the dalay and after 1 hour, it should automatically send the responder a automatic response, thanking them for the details.
--

10:48PM - 01-02-2026
-- I got errors on how it is not able to send to the correct email address. It seems that when making the form, I cannot use the actual test data and have to fill up the form and take the actual data collect to make as a basis for the variables.
-- once I have done just that, the Zap is working as intended. Samples to be attached.
