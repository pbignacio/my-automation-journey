Job Application System (Zapier + Google Forms)
Overview

This system collects job applicant data via a Google Form, stores it in a Google Spreadsheet for screening, and automatically sends a delayed confirmation email to the applicant.

Workflow Steps
## Step 1: Applicant Data Collection (Google Forms)

-- Created a Google Form to collect applicant details:

-- Name | Email | Requested Position | Job Experience

-- Published the form and confirmed it is active and accepting responses.

## Step 2: Zapier Trigger – New Form Response

-- Created a new Zap.

-- Selected Google Forms → New Form Response as the trigger.

-- Connected the correct Google account.

-- Selected the correct form by file name.

-- Tested the trigger and confirmed the form data is captured correctly.

⚠️ Correction Note
-- Initially, the trigger was set as Gmail – New Email, which was incorrect.
-- This was rectified by switching the trigger to New Form Response, which is the correct starting point for this workflow.

## Step 3: Store Applicant Data in Google Sheets

-- Created a Google Spreadsheet with the following headers:

-- Name, Email, Requested Position, Job Experience

-- Added Google Sheets → Create Spreadsheet Row as the next Zap step.

-- Mapped each form field to the corresponding spreadsheet header.

-- Enabled header-based mapping.

-- Tested the action and confirmed all form submissions are correctly recorded in the spreadsheet.

## Step 4: Delay Response (Delay by Zapier)

-- Added Delay by Zapier → Delay For.

-- Configured a delay of 1 hour for testing purposes.

-- Planned production delay: 24 hours to simulate a natural, human response time and avoid instant automated replies.

## Step 5: Send Automatic Confirmation Email

-- Added Gmail / Email by Zapier → Send Email after the delay step.

-- Configured the email to:

-- Send to the applicant’s email address (from form data)

-- Thank them for submitting their application

-- Confirm receipt of their details

-- Tested the Zap to ensure the email is sent after the delay.
